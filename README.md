# COVID-19 STATS PROJECT
Use Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
An API from Postman's open source, created COVID-19 STATS CHART.

# Improvement point
- Open source API doesn't support some countries data
  => solve it using Try-catch or looking for another API

# Next plan
- develop this version to MERN stack 
- publishing to heroku.app

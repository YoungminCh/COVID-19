# COVID-19
JS_HTML_CSS_Project

Using an API from Postman's open source, created COVID-19 STATS CHART.

# improvement point
- Open source API doesn't support some countries data
  => solve it using Try-catch
  => looking for another API

# next plan
- develop this version to MERN stack 
- publishing to heroku.app
